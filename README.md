# Insure-Clone-Challenge
Frontend Mentor challenge.  Purposely used HTML and CSS only.  Great practice for my first website I built 95% on my own.


Hello!  I'm excited to present this to anyone who is intereste in taking a look.  I've been trying to learn Web Development
for several months now, and this is my first website that I created almost entirely by myself.  The only thing I really needed
help with was the menu pop down for the mobile version.  Don't think I would've figured that out on my own.  It was a lot more
complicated than some of the Javascript ways of doing it were, but I can at least say I did it.

Doing this challenge has taught me a lot.  At one point, I completely trashed what I had and started all over again because I 
thought I could do it better.  I could probably do it again and make my code a lot less chaotic.  I essentially made two
websites, where I should've made one and edited the media queries better.

Anyway, for anyone who might stumble upon this, I'm open to critcism.  Just keep in mind, that I'm still really new to this.
I look forward to doing more of these real soon!
